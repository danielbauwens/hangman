# hangman
becode hangman test

# Description
This is my Hangman project, where the aim is to better understand OOP (object-oriented programming). I have been able to do most of the project as it is without looking up guides, however there are a lot of unfinished aspects that still need resolving.

# Installation
You can use this on Python 3.11

# Usage
To run the code, simply open your command prompt(cmd), powershell or vscode terminal window and type "python main.py" or use the path to both the python.exe and the main.py file. That would look something like this: "C:/Users/Daniel/AppData/Local/Microsoft/WindowsApps/python3.11.exe c:/Users/Daniel/Documents/GitHub/hangman/main.py"

# Timeline

# Personal Situation
My name is Daniel Bauwens. I am a Junior Data Scientist for the AI Bootcamp course, at Gent BeCode and part of the "ARAI 5" group.
